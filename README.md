# NeuralNetExample
I have implemented Neural Net model in mnist data using tensor flow by following this tutorial https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhpvH5DuVu8 . The data is the pixel values of numbers . I have classify from 1 to 10 so its a multiclass problem . The NN has 3 hidden layers with 500 nodes each . Activation function that is used is relu function . I have got 95% percent accuracy .
